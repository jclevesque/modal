'''
Modal: Musical Onset Database And Library.

Modal is a cross-platform library for musical onset detection, written in C++
and Python. It is provided here under the terms of the GNU General Public
License. It consists of code for several different types of Onset Detection
Function (ODF) and code for real-time and non-real-time onset detection.

All ODFs are implemented in both C++ and Python. The code for Onset detection
and ODF comparison is currently only available in Python.

Modal also includes a database of musical samples with hand-annotated onset
locations for ODF evaluation purposes. The database can be found in the
downloads section, it is not included in the repository.
The database is a hierarchical database, stored in the HDF5 format.
